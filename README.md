# Aphakia mouse RNA-Seq (220120_A00558_0160_AH5V77DSX3)

Aphakia mice are natural occurring mutant mice for PITX3 with two deletions ...expression is much lower  

This is the analysis of the Aphakia vs WT mouse  
The raw counts were obtained with the IIT RNA-Seq pipeline (see github RNA-Seq_mouse repository)
The rnaseq_mouse_v0.0.2.sh was used for the RNA-Seq analysis
